Autofocus field in address and send msg (done 20090607 NC)

REFACTOR: members/edit and users/edit cover very similar territory
REFACTOR: include 9 essential tips from http://www.fortytwo.gr/blog/18/9-Essential-Rails-Tips

## Bugs
login: align text boxes

design: make cancel a button

user\validate: if type in wrong code - error message does not appear

user\phone: forward - cannot forward to non-validated phone, but will not allow pages to be sent to this user
create test for the above

msgs\address: if forwarding - show who forwarding do (especially useful if unreachable)

sweep: implement as a cron job

test message status: if phone is on or off, does the message status changed?
- need to probably validate for each network

members/confirm: if error when sending SMS (for example server not internet connected), should notice (right now, does not notice), this should (1) show error message, and (2) forget confirmation code sent.

msgs/address (opt): consider showing or hiding the address list if too big for the page

Login link should not show when the user is logged in
Test- make sure user and group names are unique
Remove user in group does not work
when invalid org is passed as a param --> goes to 404 not correct error page

## Wish List:
(high)
Add user to group while in user edit mode
Add users to group in group page
Have groups link for user (or groups link, or add this functionality to the edit page)
Reset password when sending a page
Admin - allow password reset
Split messages greater than 160 characters into multiple messages so that the user does not get the max char error
SMS validated in user screen - this should be automated. Use CoverageQuery in Clickatell for SMS validation

(nice to have)
Clickatell - can we setup a better FROM address (i.e. cellpage or something like that)
Clickatell - configure system to allow use of priority queues (may be useful for hospital wide pages)
add to config/environment.rb
  config.gem 'clickatell', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
  NC: above not currently working, not is :source => 'git:...'
  
## Will not do
WILL NOT Send Message should have a Cancel/Reset button - see http://galaxyelf.com/blog/2008/08/03/reset-button-in-rails/
