<h1>Scope of this project</h1>
<p>The Project is a pilot project designed to determine if a cell-phone paging system will be useful and usable at your
    hospital. This system is designed to allow health care workers (including doctors, nurses, administrative and
    laboratory staff) to communicate more effectively by being able to send pages to each other using a computer
    with network access and cell phones.</p>

<h1>Limitation of the Project</h1>
<p>
The system may be used to communicate messages. However, <b>there can be no guarantee that messages will be delivered
    or received. The system cannot be relied on as the only means to communicate critical information regarding
    patient care. The sender CANNOT rely on this as the only means to communicate.</b> 
    Existing means already exist within the hospital, and should be used in conjunction with this system.</p>
<p>By using this system, you acknowledge your agreement of these limitations.</p>

<p>The terms of this agreement can change. The changes to the agreement will be updated on this page.</p>

<p>Date of this agreement: 28 March 2010</p>
