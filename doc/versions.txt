v0.3
0.3
    Implemented new backends
        test
            is a "dummy" backend that implements the following simple behaviours
            send message
                always succeed immediately UNLESS
                fail
                    is in the message -> this message will always fail
                error
                    is in the message -> this will raise an exception
        kannel
            a more fully fledged SMS server backend
            in development since 2005, so I have high hopes that this will provide a more stable send capability for many messages
            downsides
                another system, some more complexity, a little harder to control the queue of messages
                more complicated setup
                    kannel.conf needs to be setup
                    service needs to be setup
            other benefits
                receiving messages
                    almost "for free"
                can get delivery reports
    I'm alive msg
        sent to administrators
        should "keep the project alive" in their minds
    Can now time how long it takes to send AND receive messages
        send a message to the server
        with "cmd_time_msg" as the only statement in the body
