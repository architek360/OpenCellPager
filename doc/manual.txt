## Special tasks

### How to time how long it takes to send and receive messages

Send a message to the server itself
In the body of the message put only:
cmd_time_msg

After this is delivered, wait a while and refresh the message. When the message is received by the system and processed
the time received will be added to the message with the difference in seconds between sending and receiving.
