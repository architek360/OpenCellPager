AT+WMBS? change the band
# in tanzania: we want 5 (GSM 900/1800 MHz.)
AT+WMBS=5
# in north america: 4 (850/1900)
# Where these bands were already allocated, the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands were used instead (for example in Canada and the United States)
AT+WMBS=4

AT+CSQ	check signal strength
31 is best
